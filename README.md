# CS340-Project
Dashboard for Austin Animal Shelter using MongoDB, Python, and Dash. Built for CS-340


<ins>**Projection Description**</ins>

The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard is a web application that enables the user to filter and display data for animals from the Austin Animal Center. The features include data table filtering, a geolocation map, and a pie chart.

<ins>**Tools Used**</ins>

•	Python: Used for CRUD module to manipulate data in the database 

•	MongoDB: Used for storing the data of the animal center

•	Dash: Used for the framework of the interactive web application

<ins>**Steps Taken**</ins>

1.	Setup database and import AAC csv into MongoDB 

2.	Create CRUD module in Python (CR.py)

3.	Create interactive web layout with Dash, implement filters, geolocation maps, and pie chart, and ensure callbacks take in user inputs

4.	Debug and ensure functionality

<ins>**Challenges**</ins>

•	Filtering: initially had issues with implementing the interactive filters, adjusted the callbacks to ensure they work properly

•	Pie Chart: the visuals of the pie chart were initially not updated properly, adjusted the logic to ensure the proper visualization

<ins>**Reflection**</ins>

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
